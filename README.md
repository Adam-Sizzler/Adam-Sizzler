# 🤷‍♀️ Twitch-Miner 📺
- Well, its the easiest and best way to start getting points by NOT watching your favourite streamers.
- This bot will work on Free4Use hosting server which you will create manually with my help.
- How does it work? Well, ez. I mean, you simply turn on server and your bot starts spying every streamer you prefer to watch.
- Features: Logs on your devices, Points balance right next to logs, fully legit.
